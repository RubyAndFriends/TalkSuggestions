# TalkSuggestions

Talk ideas welcome (also if you want to hear about a topic). Just create an issue and describe the talk you would like to hold — or the topic you would like to learn more about.

* a talk should be anywhere **between 10 and 60 minutes** long
* it will be presented to a mixed group of **beginners and experienced Ruby developers**
* the presentation must follow our **code of conduct**: https://github.com/RubyAndFriends/code_of_conduct
* we welcome any topics:
  * _around Ruby_
  * _around Rails_
  * _around any other Ruby web development frameworks_
  * _around Ruby used for other things than web development_
  * _around topics that might interest Ruby developers in their work life_
  * _around language agnostic general best practices for or experiences in web development_
  * _around tools, patterns and libraries in other languages than Ruby, as long as it is somehow related (JavaScript, SCSS, Android, iOS, Messaging, Databases, CI, DevOps...)_

While talks usually work best, you could also organize a coding exercise. Please let us know early enough, so we can find a venue that has enough possibilities for our participants to work together on their notebooks.

## Where and when

Our Ruby user group is called _Barcelona on Rails_ and meets **every 3rd Thursday of a month**. While we usually meet at XING's office, exceptions do happen. So check our official channels for the latest information: 

* **Meetup:** https://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-on-Rails/
* **Twitter:** https://twitter.com/bcnrails

## Language

Usually our presentations are in English. If you would feel more comfortable doing a presentation in Spanish, please let us know! We might then try to organize a meetup which has your talk in Spanish and another talk in English — as we will always have some participants that don't understand Spanish well enough.

## No better time than now

Now that you have all the information, please propse a talk:
